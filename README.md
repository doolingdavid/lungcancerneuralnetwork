======

This repository contains the source code for a machine learning algorithm using keras and the SEER cancer data. The app asks for input from a user and outputs the predicted survival curve based on the input data.

The model in the LUNGNN folder is a keras model object that implements the transformation of censored data to a form appropriate for machine learning algorithms as described here:
